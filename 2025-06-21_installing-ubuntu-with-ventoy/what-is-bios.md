# 🖥️ What is BIOS (Basic Input/Output System)?

**BIOS** is firmware built into motherboards that initializes and tests hardware during system startup.

### 🧩 Key features:
- Executes the **POST (Power-On Self Test)**.
- Loads the operating system's bootloader.
- Provides basic configuration settings (clock, boot order, etc).

### ⚙️ Legacy vs Modern:
- BIOS is being phased out in favor of **UEFI**.
- BIOS uses **MBR partitioning** and 16-bit code.

BIOS was the standard for decades but is now largely replaced by UEFI.
