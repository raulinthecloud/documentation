## ðŸ§  Video description

In this video, I explain how to install Ubuntu from an ISO file on a computer.  
We cover the differences between Legacy BIOS and UEFI, as well as MBR and GPT partitioning.

I show where to download the correct Ubuntu ISO depending on your architecture (ARM or AMD64) and compare two tools: Rufus and Ventoy.  
In the end, I demonstrate how to use Ventoy to burn the ISO and perform a clean Ubuntu installation.
